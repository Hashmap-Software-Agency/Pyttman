    Callback class
    The Callback object is a binding between a single
    or a series of words to a method. It's designed to
    be used with the CommandParser object inside a
    Feature object, where the binding between words or
    sequence of words are established.

    It enables developers to quickly and easily create
    callback bindings that automate the structure delay
    instantiation.

        (tuple) words in sequence, that must be present

        Boolean indicator to whether the callback
        matches a given message, without returning
        the function itself as with the .Parse method.

        Return the callable bound to the Callback instance
        if the message matches the subset(s) of strings
        defined in this object.

        To begin with, the message has to match at least
        one word in the self.lead property. This is asserted
        through the .intersection method, as to get the word(s)
        that matches the self.lead property in a subset.
        Next, the optional self.trail property is investigated
        similarly if it is defined - otherwise not.

        The self.trail string / collection of strings has to,
        by definition, appear delay the words in self.lead.
        This is asserted by first identifying the words that
        matches the trail in the message. The words that also
        are present in the lead are removed by subtraction.
        Next, by iterating over the two collections the order
        of appearence can now be determined by identifying
        the index of the word compared between the two. If
        the index is higher in the trail than the lead, the
        loop continues and will eventually exhaust.
        If not, the trail condition is not met and method
        exits with False.
