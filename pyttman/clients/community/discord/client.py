class DiscordClient(discord.Client, BaseClient):
    """
    Client class for the Discord chat service.
    Token and guild are both required.

    It implements the 'on_message' method overloaded
    from `discord.Client.on_message` , and plugging it
    in to the Pyttman ecosystem, allowing the application
    logic to take care of responding to the message.

    Since the `discord.Client` class provides an
    impressive array of functionality, this class
    can be subclassed by users who wish to implement
    behavior for their application upon any of the
    other available event triggers from the discord.Client
    class, available to read in their documentation.

    Below are attributes and methods unique to the
    `DiscordClient` class.

    Attributes
    -----------
    token: :class:`str`
        Token used when authenticating with Discord's API.
        The token is deleted from the instance at time of
        connection.
    guild: :class:Â´str`
        Guild ID from Discord, in which the Bot is registered
        to and is allowed to connect to.
    message_startswith: :class:`str`
        Optional string, setting a condition for all messages
        being required to start with said string, for the bot
        to consider the message as a command to parse.
        Defaults to empty string, allowing all messages to
        be parsed.
    message_endswith: :class:`str`
        Optional string, setting a condition for all messages
        being required to end with said string, for the bot
        to consider the message as a command to parse.
        Defaults to empty string, allowing all messages to
        be parsed.
