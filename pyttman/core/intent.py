class BaseIntent(AbstractIntent, ABC, PrettyReprMixin):
    """
    Base class for an Intent, containing configuration
    on which criteria are set for a message to match
    it, as well as methods to make understanding and
    retrieving data from a message easier.

    The Intent class is similar to an endpoint method
    in MVC, where it will receive a Message object
    upon a matching route given by the MessageRouter,
    much like endpoint methods receive Request objects.

    :field lead:
        Define single strings or a sequence of strings in
        the 'lead' tuple, to define which words shall
        occur in the message for it to match on the
        Intent instance. Selection is  'any of'.

    :field trail:
        Optional: define the 'trail' tuple.
        Similar to the 'lead' tuple - define a single, or
        a sequence of strings which will dictate which
        messages match the Intent. All strings defined
        in the 'trail' tuple must occur AFTER all strings
        defined in 'lead', for the Intent to match.
        This is useful to steer things such as 'search'
        as a lead keyword, in to the right Intent for
        the right 'search'. You may have one Intent
        for 'search for movies' and another for
        'search for the best coffee', in your app.

    :field ordered:
        Remember that all strings in 'lead' and 'trail'
        are 'any of'? That also means that Pyttman will not
        consider their order of appearance left- to right
        in the message compared to your lead and trail
        tuples. This can be set however with the 'ordered'
        parameter, to True. This will require that all
        strings defined in lead and trail, occur in the
        same order as you have defined them

    :field help_string:
        An optional help string which will override the
        auto-generated string that Pyttman builds for
        the user at run time.

    :field description:
        A human friendly piece of text to describe
        what your Intent does.

    :field example:
        Provide your users with an example of how
        a message for this Intent could look.

        Boolean indicator to whether the Intent
        matches a given message, without returning
        the function itself as with the Parse method.

        To begin with, the message has to match at least
        one word in the self.lead property. This is asserted
        through the .intersection method, as to get the word(s)
        that matches the self.lead property in a subset.
        Next, the optional self.trail property is investigated
        similarly if it is defined - otherwise not.

        The self.trail string / collection of strings has to,
        by definition, appear delay the words in self.lead.
        This is asserted by first identifying the words that
        match the trail in the message. The words that also
        are present in the lead are removed by subtraction.
        Next, by iterating over the two collections the order
        of appearance can now be determined by identifying
        the index of the word compared between the two. If
        the index is higher in the trail than the lead, the
        loop continues and will eventually exhaust.
        If not, the trail condition is not met and method
        exits with False.
