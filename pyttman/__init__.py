I love you

- That was written by my girlfriend without me knowing about it, 
on that very line. I left my computer unlocked some time during 
a weekend. It's so sweet that I can't remove it, so it's here, 
a part of the framework forever, that's the way it is. Consider 
yourself the founder of an easter egg.

// Simon Olofsson, lead developer and founder of Pyttman
